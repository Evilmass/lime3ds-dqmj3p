This is a fork of the source code of the final version of Lime3DS, utilizing the core timing prior to Citra nightly-1544, to enhance performance on Dragon Quest Monster Joker 3 Professional (performance may degrade on many other games).

It is also beneficial if, for some reason, you cannot run nightly-1543 (for example, if you use an AMD GPU that no longer supports drivers compatible with nightly-1543).

This fork was inspired by Slashaim's fork of the old Citra code.
